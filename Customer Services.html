						<hr>
						<h3 id="shippingpolicy">Shipping Policy</h3>
						<p>We ship in-stock orders as soon as possible. This is often the day you placed it or the day after, but there are many situations where it will take longer.<br>
							You will be sent at least 2 emails for each order you place:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The Order Confirmation verifies that your order is in our system. Please review the email to make sure all the information is correct.</li>
							<li>The Ship Notification is to let you know that your order is ready to go. It will be picked up by the shipping company the next time they come by our building.</li>
						</ul>
						<hr>
						<h3 id="shippingmethod">Shipping Method</h3>
						<p>We offer 4 shipping options to allow you to decide when you get your stuff. Days listed are from when the order ships:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Next Business Day is FedEx Standard Overnight. Delivery is guaranteed by 3pm the next business day, may be later for rural.</li>
							<li>2 Business Days is FedEx 2-day. Delivery is guaranteed by the end of the second business day.</li>
							<li>2-6 Business Days is FedEx Ground. All orders ship from Colorado, so the closer you are to us, the sooner this option will arrive.</li>
							<li>3-11 Business Days is FedEx Smartpost. Please note rural areas may take additional time to deliver. This option is carried by FedEx to a post office near your address, then handed over to the postal service for delivery with your normal US mail. Not tracked or insured, only allowed for less than $300. May take up to 3 business days to leave our facility.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>FedEx does not normally deliver on Saturday, but may for an additional charge. <br>We don’t normally offer USPS or UPS shipping options, but you may see them in the following cases:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>You have a verified UPS account number on file with us</li>
							<li>You are shipping to a PO box or military address</li>
							<li>Your shipping address is not returning a valid quote from FedEx</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>Local Pickup</h5>
						<p>If your shipping address is in kano state, you’ll see Local Pickup as a shipping method in checkout. If you select this option, we’ll hold your order here so you can come pick it up</p>
						<h4>P.O Boxes</h4>
						<p>FedEx and UPS do not deliver to PO Boxes. If your shipping address is a PO Box, please check the “This address is a P.O. Box” option when entering your address. You will then have the option to select a USPS option.</p>
						<h4>Signature Requirement</h4>
						<p>All US orders are shipped “Signature Not Required” by default; however, the shipping company may decide to require a signature depending on the value or destination. If you want your order to require a signature for delivery, please contact Customer Service. If a “Signature Not Required” package is left at the door but isn’t there when you get home, neither Steamledge nor the shipping company can be held responsible.</p>
						<h4>Saturday Delivery</h4>
						<p>FedEx and UPS do not normally deliver on Saturday, but can for an additional charge of $15. If you would like your package to ship on a Friday for delivery Saturday, please follow these steps:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Make sure it is before 2pm Western Time on a Friday. We can’t guarantee shipment that day if it is later.</li>
							<li>Place your order through our website, selecting either FedEx Priority Overnight or UPS Next Day Air for the shipping method and Offline Payment as the payment method.</li>
							<li>We’ll add the $15 to the original shipping cost calculated, take payment, and release your order for shipment.</li>
						</ol>
						<h4>Local Customers</h4>
						<p>If your address is in Kano state, you can pick your order at our office.. Here is our Address:</p>
							<blockquote>Hotoro, Tsamiyar Boka<br>opposite police Station<br> Kano State.</blockquote>
						<hr>
						<h3 id="#returnpolicy">Return Policy </h3>
						<p>Packages can be returned to us for many reasons. Depending on the reason for return, there may be additional charges applied to your order. Please read below for more information:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Packages can be returned to us for missing or incorrect address information. Please take a moment to check and make sure your address book is up to date. There is also an order review page where you can double check this information. If the carrier you select charges us to return the package, we will either a) deduct that from your refund if you want to cancel or b) if you choose to re-ship the package it will be added to the cost of the re-shipment fee.</li>
							<li>Packages can be returned to us if they are refused at customs for any reason. Sometimes we choose to get these packages back. If there are any customs fees and shipping charges to return your order, this will be deducted from the refund (if you want to cancel the order) or added to the re-shipment fee if you want to re-ship the order.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Please note that if your package is marked to be returned to SparkFun, it could take longer than expected to receive as these packages are not marked as a priority from the shipping company. Sometimes it can take a couple of weeks before we get them back! <br>We will only hold a returned package for one week before we restock and refund (if applicable). If you are wondering where your order is, please also check your spam filter as we may be trying to get a hold of you!<br>If you think your package is going to be returned to us, please send us an email to customerservice@steamledge.com so we can note your order and wait for its return. </p>
						<hr>

						<h4>Credit Card</h4>
						<p>We accept Visa, MasterCard</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We can only refund for up to 90 days from the date of the charge. After that time, we will need to refund with store credit or another method.</li>
							<li>In order to help prevent payment fraud, we may need to hold your order for further verification. We will be in contact if this is applies to you.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Paypal</h4>
						<p>If you select PayPal during checkout, you will be redirected to that website, then back to ours to complete your order.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If your order has backorders, you may not be redirected to the PayPal site. This is because we do not take payment until your order is ready to ship. Once everything is in stock, we’ll send you a money request.</li>
							<li>Make sure your addresses are correct on our site. We do not verify any address information with PayPal.</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Offline Payments</h4>
						<p>Use this option to get your order in the system now and handle payment later. It’s also useful if you need a quote to get a purchase approved. Place the order with this option and use the resulting invoice as the quote. Then the order is sitting right here waiting for you once payment is available. <br> If you no longer need the order as placed, please contact Customer Service so we can cancel it.<br>This option is not available for guest checkout. </p>
